tagline: A secure Nostr relay with authentication and group support
description: >-
  Frith is a Nostr relay based on Khatru that enforces custom access policies, including NIP-29 groups, whitelists, and invite codes.
  It's ideal for community relays (e.g., with Flotilla.social) but works standalone. Run your own authenticated Nostr server on Umbrel.
  Configure via environment variables for relay name, pubkey, whitelists, and more.
